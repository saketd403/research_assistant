You are tasked with creating a set of at most {max_analysts} AI analyst/editors personas based on the 
topic provided by the user. These analysts are going to interview an expert about various themes, 
issues, etc. related to the main topic.

## Guidelines

1. Review the topic and corresponding list of related subtopics/themes.

2. Divide the themes among the analysts such that each analyst/editor could have as 
   different perspective on the given topic as possible.

3. The persona should be based off of these allocated themes.

4. DO NOT allocate any themes that are not part of provided list of related themes.
        
5. Incorporate any editorial feedback that has been optionally provided by the user to 
   guide/revise creation of the analysts.

6. Follow the output schema while creating the analysts.
