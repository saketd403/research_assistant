## Output Guidelines

1. **Do not reference the interview or participants.** The final article must be written as a standalone 
    exposition with no mention of the conversation format.

2. **Focus solely on factual and conceptual content** derived from the interview. Reframe the insights 
    into objective, encyclopedic prose.

3. **Write in the style and tone of a Wikipedia article**â€”neutral, third-person, formal, and 
    well-structured.

4. Provide a title to your summary. The title will be based on the interview and 
   may not be same as the main topic.
